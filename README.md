## About

Paper wallets are an easy way to drive adoption since they introduce the concept of public/private keys, while still _feeling like_ physical, fiat currency. This tool is designed to aid in printing hundreds or thousands of paper wallets on standard business cards.

## Features

- Generates a .csv file with the mnemonic seed, public and private keys for 1,000 wallets (or more).

## Future plans

- Basic instructions for trading directly and setting up a mobile wallet
- Business-card templates
- Auto-populate labels with mnemonic phrase using Microsoft Word mail merge
- QR code for recovery (note: Status and Coinbase mobile wallets do not currently allow QR-code recovery.)
